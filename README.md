# Proposing a Change to the Assignment Mechanism in Precision Oncology Programs

The repository contains an analysis of the drug sensitivities in cancer dataset by Iorio et al. in two highly related settings: 

* enabling Causal Inference in Precision Oncology programs 
* optimizing the Assignment Mechanism in Precision Oncology programs using contextual bandits
