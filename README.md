# Proposing a Change to the Assignment Mechanism in Precision Oncology Programs to enable Causal Inference

The repository contains an analysis of the drug sensitivities in cancer dataset by Iorio et al. in two highly related settings: 

* enabling Causal Inference in Precision Oncology programs 
* optimizing the Assignment Mechanism in Precision Oncology programs using contextual bandits

The work has been submitted as course work for CS282R (Harvard and Google Brain) and BMI707 (Harvard Medical School).
